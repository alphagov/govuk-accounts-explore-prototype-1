# GOV.UK Accounts Prototype

A prototype to allow us to test GOV.UK Accounts features in user testing
and within the team.

Note this prototype is forked from the explore-prototype-4.
This is largely a convenience to take advantage of a well designed prototype
header and functionality to allow GOV.UK guidance to appear within the prototype.

Final implementation may differ.
