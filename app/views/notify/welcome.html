<p>
You have created your GOV.UK account.
</p>

<p>GOV.UK accounts are new. At the moment you can only use your GOV.UK account with a few services.</p>

<p>GOV.UK accounts are currently separate from other government accounts (for example Government Gateway or Universal Credit).</p>


<p>In the future, you'll be able to use your GOV.UK account to sign in to most services on GOV.UK.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">

      If you have questions, problems or suggestions for how we could make your GOV.UK account better, you can contact us: <a href="#">https://signin.account.gov.uk/contact-us?referer=accountCreatedEmail</a>
