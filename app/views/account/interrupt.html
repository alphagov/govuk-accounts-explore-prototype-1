<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">GOV.​UK accounts are new</h3>
<p>They are a first step towards creating a single account where you can access all your government services. </p>
<p>GOV.UK accounts  will eventually replace other government accounts<!-- such as Government Gateway-->.

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  At the moment, GOV.UK accounts are separate from <a href="/sign-in">other government accounts</a> (for example Government Gateway or Universal Credit).

  Currently, you can only use a GOV.UK account to manage your GOV.UK email subscriptions.

  We’ll be adding more features and services in the next few months.
