<p>In the future, you'll be able to use your GOV.UK account to sign in to most services on GOV.UK.</p>
<p>
Currently GOV.UK accounts are separate from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/sign-in">other government accounts</a> (for example Government Gateway or Universal Credit).
</p>
<p>
  At the moment you can only use your GOV.UK account with a few services.

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If you have other GOV.UK email subscriptions</h3>
<p>If you have subscriptions to other GOV.UK topics or pages, these will be moved to your new account so you can manage all your subscriptions in one place.</p>
